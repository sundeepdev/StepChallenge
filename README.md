# StepChallenge

This app allows its users to come in a group and create a Step Challenge between each other. 
There are two type of users. Step Challenge users and Admin users. The Admin or the person who created the challenge would be able to 
add/invite people.

Just to start as the app is only available in Android, we are trying to read data from Google Sheets, so that people can update there steps
from Desktop or iPhone as needed.

The current feature of the apps involves:

1. Show a list of users
2. Show the steps of the logged in user.
3. Show the profile of the logged in user.

The future features would be:
1. Allow admin to create a challenge.
2. Allow admin to invite and add users to the challenge.
3. Allow all the users to add their step.
4. Allow all the users to see their progress.
5. Leaderboard of the Day, Week and Month.
6. Get notification whenever anyone adds their step in the challenge to keep the motivation.

The application would build in alignment to Clean Architecture and MVI patter using Jetpack Compose, ViewModels, Hilt, Retrofit.
